HC5, HC06 are good old classic to communicate to but you also Have BLE on MicroProcessor and BLE HM10 HC08... What are all those ? And how to connect them to Unity


If you want to communicate with a Micro controller you can do it in several ways:
- USB: a classic that need cable but is working like charm
- Classic Bluetooth: For example HC05 and HC06
- BLE on the microcontrooller: For example the Feather or Raspberry Pi Pico W
- BLE with a key HM10 HC08: That I don't know but need to learn.
- Wifi: that I never learn but seem a bit complexe to link too without server or several wifi.

While software keystroke simulation is perfect because it allows you to know buy stuffs.
Sometime it is less detectable and more "switchable" to use an hardware to inject keystroke.
And when you do that you will need cable or Bluetooth.

So when you are using Unity3D on Window and Android... How to you use those ?
